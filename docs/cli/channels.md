## Troubleshooting

- Run `openclaw status --deep` for a broad probe.

- Use `openclaw doctor` for guided fixes.

- `openclaw channels list` prints `Claude: HTTP 403 ... user:profile` → usage snapshot needs the `user:profile` scope. Use `--no-usage`, or provide a claude.ai session key (`CLAUDE_WEB_SESSION_KEY` / `CLAUDE_WEB_COOKIE`), or re-auth via Claude Code CLI.

## Capabilities probe

Fetch provider capability hints (intents/scopes where available) plus static feature support:

```
openclaw channels capabilities
openclaw channels capabilities --channel discord --target channel:123

```

Notes:

- `--channel` is optional; omit it to list every channel (including extensions).

- `--target` accepts `channel:<id>` or a raw numeric channel id and only applies to Discord.

- Probes are provider-specific: Discord intents + optional channel permissions; Slack bot + user scopes; Telegram bot flags + webhook; Signal daemon version; MS Teams app token + Graph roles/scopes (annotated where known). Channels without probes report `Probe: unavailable`.

## Resolve names to IDs

Resolve channel/user names to IDs using the provider directory:

```
openclaw channels resolve --channel slack "#general" "@jane"
openclaw channels resolve --channel discord "My Server/#support" "@someone"
openclaw channels resolve --channel matrix "Project Room"

```

Notes:

- Use `--kind user|group|auto` to force the target type.

- Resolution prefers active matches when multiple entries share the same name.
